This repository contains the frontend code for the 3D Printable Spotify Code Generator. It's a Vue.js application that provides the user interface for generating the necessary Base-8 codes from a Spotify URL. Beside that it provides color suggestions for 3D-printing and downloadable PDF files to print the album cover image.

## üë®‚Äçüíª A Note from the Creator

This project was a fantastic learning experience. It was my first time trying out Vue.js, therefore it may not be perfect. I defintely see much room for improving the code e.g. in structure and im working on a cleaner version if time allows it. I'm proud of how it turned out and hope you enjoy using it!
